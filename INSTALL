Installation Instructions
*************************

To build and install natively under Linux,
    autoreconf -i
    ./configure
    make
    make install

Then copy 'pixelserv-tls' binary to a directory of your choice e.g /usr/loca/bin.

To cross compile, you have two choices:

1) Export environment variables AR, CC, AS, LD, RANLIB, STRIP where they 
   point to the cross-compiler's equivalents. Then

    autoreconf -i
    ./configure
    make

2) Use the old Makefile-XC. E.g. to build for ASUSWRT,

   make -f Makefile-XC arm

   The above step assume you've setup properly the build environment of the 
   cross compiler and dependent libraries.
