Create a symbolic link with destination "include/openssl" and source equal to your
taraget platform's openssl repository. For example,

  ln -s ~/asuswrt-merlin/release/src/router/openssl/include/openssl include/openssl

Same set of headers is okay for multiple targets only if openssl versions are same or
variation between versions is trivial.

If no symoblic link is created, headers will be included from your host's default 
e.g. /usr/include/openssl if it's available.

Both static and shared libraries shall be symlinked or copied to the respective
target's directory:

  amd64 - for 64-bit x86
  arm   - for ARM; tested on Asuswrt-Merlin
  mips  - for MIPS; tested on Asuswrt-Merlin
