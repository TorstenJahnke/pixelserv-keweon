  Google Chrome starts to mark less secure ciphers such as RSA as obsolete. 
  Less secure ciphers will be depreciated in TLS v1.3.
* Added X509v3 Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension to generated certificates.
  Google Chrome starting with v58 mark certificates without SAN as invalid, enforcing
  RFC 2818 specified in 2000!

2017-1-26 v35.HZ12.Ki-p1

* Fixed default behavior for missing -p and/or -k command line options.
  With the change, -p or -k can be separately and optionally specified.

2016-9-3 v35.HZ12.Ki

* Added support for Intermediate CA certs. This enables pixelserv to take a root
  CA cert or any intermediate CA cert on a trusted hierarchy to be the CA cert
  for automatic certificate generation. Original issue reported by Popov. Thanks.
* Removal of arbitrary limitation on CA certificates' subject.
* Moved to pthread for all multiprocessing. fork() is still available as compile
  option. Faster performance on serving client requests and generating certificates.
* New calculations for average length per request (avg) and average processing time
  per request (tav). This is huge in a sense that the old methods basically break
  down after serving the initial hundreds or maybe thousands of requests.
* New layout and explanatory notes on HTML stats page.
* 32-bit x86 build supported in 64-bit Linux environment. Verified and Makefile
  contributed by Popov.

2016-3-13 v35.HZ12.Kh

* Added access log toggle through HTTP URL. This allows turning on/off access log
  without restarting pixelserv-tls.
* Added result code of a processed request to access log - for diagnosis purpose.

2015-12-24 v35.HZ12.Kg

* Fixed serial number in generated certificates. This increases pixelserv compatibility
  with Firefox. (Issue reported by nick8565. Thanks)

2015-11-10 v35.HZ12.Kf

* Set correct file permission for /tmp/pixelcerts - the pipe for sending certificate
  generation request between "server" and "cert generator". Pixelserv can run as root
  or non-root after this change. 
* Changed HTML servstats further to be human readable.
* Fixed an issue where garbled HTML code logged in access log when pixelserv quits.

  parser friendly.

2015-10-12 v35.HZ12.Kd

* Added automatic generation of certificates for https.
* Added four new stats:
     slh (cert exists and used)
     slm (cert missing for the ad domain)
     sle (error in existing certs)
     slu (none of the above)
